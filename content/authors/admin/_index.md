Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://scripps.ucsd.edu/"> Scripps Institution of Oceanography </a> in the <a href="https://semmenslab.org/"> Semmens </a> and <a href="https://cpetrik.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/"> Petrik </a> Labs, where I work on modeling the fate and transport of pollutants from the recently rediscovered San Pedro Basin barrel field though the California pelagic food web. Broadly, I'm interested in harnessing quantitative methods to address questions in aquatic science. Working at spatial scales the size of continents and over time periods spanning decades, I've become adept gathering, wrangling, and integrating high volume data of various types to generate novel insights. 

I obtained my PhD from <a href="https://uw.edu/"> University of Washington's </a> <a href="https://quantitative.uw.edu/graduate/"> Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management </a> program, where I worked with Drs. <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/lwm/aem/people/steel.html/"> E. Ashley Steel </a> and <a href="http://holtgrievelab.uw.edu/"> Gordon Holtgrieve</a>. Ultimately, my research focused on understanding how river water source, temperature and hydrology have changed in the past and are likely to change in the future. My dissertation research aimed to help resource managers maintain ecosystem function and habitat by understanding what climate driven changes to rivers have already occurred and by developing inexpensive, broadly applicable tools to understand what river basins may be at risk in the future.
