abstract: "Pacific salmon (Oncoryhnchus spp.) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) are introduced species stocked in the Laurentian Great Lakes. In their native range, salmon deliver material that enhances growth, alters isotopic ratios, and increases contaminant burdens of resident fish. However, whether salmon subsidies mediate interactions between competing species is unknown. Here, we employed a mesocosm experiment and a simulation model to determine if salmon tissue consumption influences brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) growth, isotopic ratios, and mercury concentrations and whether these were modified by brown trout. Our results indicate that brook trout growth did not increase with provision of salmon tissue and was not reduced by brown trout. However, brook trout exhibited isotopic enrichment and increased mercury concentrations, suggesting dietary intake of salmon tissue. Because salmon eggs have a higher energy density and lower mercury concentration compared with salmon tissue, our simulation model suggests that consumption of salmon eggs rather than tissue can increase growth while reducing mercury accumulation. Overall, our results suggest that the role of introduced Pacific salmon is dependent on both food quantity and quality along with diet contaminant concentrations."
